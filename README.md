# My NVIM Configuration
This repository is made with the main idea of have my vim configuration centralized, tracked and backed up for the future. Also with this idea we can have different versions of it and choose the better one depending the situation, but in general we'll have only main version to increase my productivity.

## Version
- NVIM v0.4.4
